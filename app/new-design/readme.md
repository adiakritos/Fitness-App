### Conventions

-- ALWAYS USE PERFECT INDENTATION AND SPACING/LINE BREAKS --

Indentation:
 * 2 spaces on HTML/ERB
 * 4 spaces on JS
 * 4 spaces on CSS
 * 1 line break between JS/CSS functions/declarations
 * 1 line break between HTML main semantic areas, no line breaks otherwise
 * Prefer "double quotes" for HTML attributes
 * Prefer 'single quotes' for JS/Ruby unless its a "#{interpolated} string"

Rails:
 * Prefer `symbol: value` over `:symbol => value`
 * Prefer and/or over &&/||
 * Order of models:
   * define constants
