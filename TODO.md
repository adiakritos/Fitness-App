## Features

 * A sortable food table that would allow me to discover foods for different needs
    * for example, lets say I need some extra fat in my diet but Im tired of butter or mayo..
    * I can click on "fat" and then all the fatty foods in the database will populate. Then,
    * I can click on the fat tab at the top of the table to sort the fats from highest to least
    * Then I can preview all the different high fat foods
    * Or say I want a carb that has lots of fat. 
    * I can click the carb tab to get all the carb foods, then sort them by the carbs with the most fat
    * Same thing for protein
